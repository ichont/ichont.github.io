I am a researcher in the field of AI. I am currently working at Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Digital Security, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). Previously, I worked with [Prof. Guo](https://ist.dlmu.edu.cn/info/1287/6768.htm) at [TSMC](http://www.tsmclab.com) Group, conducting research in the fields of code intelligence and EDA intelligence in Daliann Maritime University(DLMU). Besides, I had a brief study session with [Prof. Liu](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/yangliu/home_cn)(XJTU). Currently, my research fields include AI security, Multimodal Large Models, and AIGC.
